I'm a computer scientist working in the intersection of industry and academia on the various projects related to data analysis, natural language processing and digital humanities.

## In academia

I've graduated from [PUT Pozna≈Ñ](https://www.put.poznan.pl/) with BSc in Computer Science. Currently I'm a student of [MSc in Digital Humanities](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/digital-humanities/) on [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). During my studies I've participated in various research grants and projects such as [Optilion](https://www.optil.io/optilion/about-ncbir), [GEANT](https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT_Project_GN4-3), [CERN Openlab](https://openlab.cern/project/data-analytics-cloud-0) and [CROSS accomoji](https://accomoji.ch). Currently, I'm highly scoped on NLP driven by ML, especially language modeling and generation. My bachelor thesis - [Cooking recipes generator utilizing a deep learning-based language model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345308878_Cooking_recipes_generator_utilizing_a_deep_learning-based_language_model) was awarded the [Most Innovative prize](https://ieee.pl/?q=node/202) by the polish section of IEEE.

## In industry

I've worked in industry previously on the positions of Backend Developer, Fullstack, DevOps Engineer and Cloud Engineer. Since September 2021, I work in [Allegro.pl ML Research lab](https://ml.allegro.tech/) as full-time ML Researcher to synchronize my academic research with the daily work duties.

## In free time

Since 2014 I serve as a scout leader in [the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association](https://zhp.pl/) where I've organized summer camps for youth, served as a leader of many projects and run multiple successful actions and assemblies.
