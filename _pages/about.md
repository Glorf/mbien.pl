I'm a computer scientist working in the intersection of industry and academia on the various projects related to data analysis, natural language processing and digital humanities.

## In academia

I've graduated from [PUT Poznań](https://www.put.poznan.pl/) with BSc in Computer Science, and from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with [MSc in Digital Humanities](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/digital-humanities/). During my studies I've participated in various research grants and projects such as [Optilion](https://www.optil.io/optilion/about-ncbir), [GEANT](https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT_Project_GN4-3), [CERN Openlab](https://openlab.cern/project/data-analytics-cloud-0) and [CROSS accomoji](https://accomoji.ch). Currently, I'm building NLP solutions driven by ML, using language modeling and text generation. My bachelor thesis - [Cooking recipes generator utilizing a deep learning-based language model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345308878_Cooking_recipes_generator_utilizing_a_deep_learning-based_language_model) was awarded the [Most Innovative prize](https://ieee.pl/?q=node/202) by the polish section of IEEE. I prepared my master thesis on evaluation of Natural Language Generation in [EPFL NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch/).

## In industry

I've worked in industry previously on the positions of Backend Developer, Fullstack, DevOps Engineer and Cloud Engineer. Since September 2021, I work in [Allegro.pl ML Research lab](https://ml.allegro.tech/) as full-time ML Researcher to synchronize my academic research with the daily work duties.

In the meantime, I co-founded a startup called [Epicer](https://epicer.co) - a cooking recipe generator based on the generative models. Our solution was selected to participate in 2022 edition of [Startup Impact Program](https://kozminskihub.com/startup-impact-program/) organized by [Kozminski Business Hub](https://kozminskihub.com/) with partnership with [Żabka](https://zabkagroup.com/).

## In free time

Since 2014 I serve as a scout leader in [the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association](https://zhp.pl/) where I've organized summer camps for youth, served as a leader of many projects and run multiple successful actions and assemblies.
